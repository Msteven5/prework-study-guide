# prework-study-guide

## Description

This project is a first look into a world of coding, an opportunity for myself to "dip my toe" into a vastly interesting and expansive programming knowledge base. I built this to help organize the information I was given during the pre-work for my coding bootcamp. This is just an easily digestible way to go about informing others and myself about the very basics of coding knowledge. I learned a lot along the way, somethings that are new, and some that added onto knowledge that was already there.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide offers basic coding knowledge organized in a simple way. It goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. 3 of the 4 are on the surface, easy to see how they have been used, however to see the JavaScript in practice, one must open the DevTools to see what has been done.
